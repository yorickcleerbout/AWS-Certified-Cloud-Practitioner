# Chapter Fourteen: Serverless

## Lambda
---

### What Is Lambda? (Simplified)

Lambda is serverless computing. It is the next generation of cloud computing that will replace EC2 instances (for the most part).

### AWS Definition of Lambda

AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you **run code without provisioning or managing servers**. AWS Lambda **executes your code only when needed and scales automatically**, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. **You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no change when your code is not running**. With AWS Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or back-end service - all with zero administration. AWS Lambda **runs you code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all the administration of the compute resources, including server and operation system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, and code monitoring and logging**. All you need to do is supply your code in one of the languages that AWS Lambda supports (currently Node.js, Java C#, Ruby, Go, .NET Core and Python).

### Additional Benefits

- No servers to manage
- Continuous scaling
- Subsecond metering
- Integrates with almost all other AWS services

### Primary Use Cases

- Data processing
- Real-time file processing
- Real-time stream processing
- Build serverless back-ends for web, mobile, IoT, and third-party API requests
